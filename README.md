# note-taker

## Description
This is a simple Note Taker application that allows users to add, view saved notes and also delete the notes if the user don't need that note anymore. This application uses an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Function

This team profile generator functions by opening your integrated terminal. Type node index.js in your terminal, when the application runs it then presents a series of questions to the user. When done your responses will be saved in the team.html file.

## Credits

I would like to give credit to my Varsity Tutor for taking the time to help me understand how to use the terminal and vsCode to build this team profile generator.
